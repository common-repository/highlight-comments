Highlight Comments allows you to highlight comments, which are worth reading. It can highlight your own comments as well and is fully customizable.

== Description ==

If you want to show your readers which comments on a specific post are worth reading, just click on a 'highlight'-link below them and they will be highlighted automatically (uses custom-fields). This plug-in also adds functionality to highlight your own comments, e.g. the blog author.

Additionally, Highlight Comments will create a list of noteworthy comments and put it below your post. It would then look like this: `There are currently 2 comments highlighted: [comment-id], [comment-id]`. If you wish, you can even change this text.

Eventually, you can set-up your Cascading-Style-Sheets that will be used to highlight comments via the administrator-GUI of Wordpress.

You can deactivate and activate every feature separately.

== Installation ==

The installation is as easy as this:

1. Upload the whole directory `highlight-comments` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Options can be found in your settings panel on the tab 'Highlight Comments'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does the idea come from? =

After a few authors of blogs wished to have a plugin that enables the ability to highlight some comments on their blog which else wouldn't get the attention they deserve of the readers, I searched one and found '[Comment Hilite](http://rebelpixel.com/projects/rp-comment-hilite/)'. Unfortunately, this plugin works only with older versions of WP.
Later, I explored the plugin '[Highlight Author Comments](http://rmarsh.com/plugins/highlight-comments/)', which highlights only comments of authors.
Highlight Comments is a plugin that combines Comment Hilite and Highlight Author Comments. Its goal is to work on current WP-versions.
